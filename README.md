# Shortest_path_for_ship_navigation
Ship Routing Application
Overview
The Ship Routing Application is an Android-based app designed to calculate the most efficient and safe routes for ships navigating ocean waters, with a particular focus on routes in the Indian Ocean. The app utilizes a customized shortest path algorithm to optimize voyage parameters such as travel time, safety, and fuel consumption, helping ship operators make better-informed routing decisions. By integrating nautical maps and leveraging SQL databases for secure user login, the application offers a comprehensive platform for maritime navigation and logistics.

###Features
Optimal Route Calculation:
Uses an advanced shortest path algorithm to determine the most efficient routes for ships, factoring in voyage time, safety, and fuel efficiency.
Nautical Map Integration:
Offers access to nautical maps that display real-time positioning and possible routes for enhanced navigation.
Weather Data Visualization:
Displays real-time weather data in a graphical format, allowing users to plan routes with consideration of weather conditions.
User Management:
Supports user authentication with a secure login system managed via an SQL database.
Route Selection Interface:
Includes a "Select Route" feature that allows users to choose from pre-calculated optimal routes or customize their own based on preferences and ship specifications.
Technology Stack
Android: For the front-end interface and user experience.
Java: Core language used to develop and integrate all application functionalities.
SQL Database: Manages user authentication and securely stores user data.
API Integration: Real-time weather data API (or alternative if needed).
Installation
To set up the project locally:

Clone the repository:
